    abstract = "{The standard bootstrap (SBS), despite being computationally intensive, is widely used in maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses. We recently proposed the ultrafast bootstrap approximation (UFBoot) to reduce computing time while achieving more unbiased branch supports than SBS under mild model violations. UFBoot has been steadily adopted as an efficient alternative to SBS and other bootstrap approaches. Here, we present UFBoot2, which substantially accelerates UFBoot and reduces the risk of overestimating branch supports due to polytomies or severe model violations. Additionally, UFBoot2 provides suitable bootstrap resampling strategies for phylogenomic data. UFBoot2 is 778 times (median) faster than SBS and 8.4 times (median) faster than RAxML rapid bootstrap on tested data sets. UFBoot2 is implemented in the IQ-TREE software package version 1.6 and freely available at http://www.iqtree.org.}",

	abstract = {Author summary Bayesian phylogenetic inference methods have undergone considerable development in recent years, and joint modelling of rich evolutionary data, including genomes, phenotypes and fossil occurrences is increasingly common. Advanced computational software packages that allow robust development of compatible (sub-)models which can be composed into a full model hierarchy have played a key role in these developments. Developing scientific software is increasingly crucial to advancement in many fields of biology. The challenges range from practical software development and engineering, distributed team coordination, conceptual development and statistical modelling, to validation and testing. BEAST 2 is one such computational software platform for phylogenetics, population genetics and phylodynamics, and was first announced over 4 years ago. Here we describe the full range of new tools and models available on the BEAST 2.5 platform, which expand joint evolutionary inference in many new directions, especially for joint inference over multiple data types, non-tree models and complex phylodynamics.},

This report shows actual examples to explain how these features work, alone and in combination. Some examples incorrectly aligned by MAFFT are also shown to clarify its limitations. We discuss how to avoid misalignments, and our ongoing efforts to overcome such limitations.}",

    abstract = "{Diverse disciplines in biology process and analyze multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) and phylogenetic trees to evaluate their information content, infer evolutionary events and processes and predict gene function. However, automated processing of MSAs and trees remains a challenge due to the lack of a unified toolkit. To fill this gap, we introduce PhyKIT, a toolkit for the UNIX shell environment with 30 functions that process MSAs and trees, including but not limited to estimation of mutation rate, evaluation of sequence composition biases, calculation of the degree of violation of a molecular clock and collapsing bipartitions (internal branches) with low support.To demonstrate the utility of PhyKIT, we detail three use cases: (1) summarizing information content in MSAs and phylogenetic trees for diagnosing potential biases in sequence or tree data; (2) evaluating gene–gene covariation of evolutionary rates to identify functional relationships, including novel ones, among genes and (3) identify lack of resolution events or polytomies in phylogenetic trees, which are suggestive of rapid radiation events or lack of data. We anticipate PhyKIT will be useful for processing, examining and deriving biological meaning from increasingly large phylogenomic datasets.PhyKIT is freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/JLSteenwyk/PhyKIT), PyPi (https://pypi.org/project/phykit/) and the Anaconda Cloud (https://anaconda.org/JLSteenwyk/phykit) under the MIT license with extensive documentation and user tutorials (https://jlsteenwyk.com/PhyKIT).Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",
